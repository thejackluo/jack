# Story 1.2: Implement Dynamic Blog System with Filtering & Analytics

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** site owner,
**I want** a dynamic, filterable blog system,
**so that** I can easily display all 40 of my articles and allow visitors to find relevant content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new `/writing` page dynamically lists all blog posts from the Astro content collection established in Story 1.0.
2. The listing and detail routes read the Story 1.0 blog schema (`title`, `publishDate`, `tags`, `excerpt`, `heroImage`, etc.) without requiring schema changes.
3. The `/writing` page includes UI controls to filter blog posts by tags or year.
4. Clicking a blog post navigates to its unique page (e.g., `/writing/my-first-post`).
5. The blog post layout renders Markdown body content with the researched tone and structure guidance from Story 1.0 clearly represented (e.g., CTA sections, pull quotes as applicable).
6. A simple analytics tool is integrated to track blog post views.
7. Rendering is validated against both migrated legacy entries and a net-new blog created via the Story 1.0 template.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build `/writing` listing page backed by Astro content collections (AC: 1, 2, 3)

  - [x] Update contributor docs if additional steps are required for maintaining filters or analytics (AC: 7) [Source: architecture/migration-strategy.md#migration-strategy]
- [x] Add automated tests and build checks (AC: 3, 4, 7)
  - [x] Cover filter state management with Vitest unit tests for the interactive component logic (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
  - [x] Add a Playwright smoke scenario that validates filtering and navigation to a post in the built site (AC: 4, 7) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
  - [x] Run `npm run build` (and ensure CI hook) to verify the static output after content changes (AC: 7) [Source: architecture/build-deployment-architecture.md#production-build-flow]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 delivered the shared Base layout, header/footer components, and Plausible integration that the `/writing` pages must reuse for consistent navigation and analytics. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.foundational-content-engine-ssg-setup.md#file-list]
- Story 1.0 migrated legacy blogs into Astro content collections and established authoring workflows/templates that this story consumes. [Source: docs/stories/1.0.markdown-content-seeding.md#tasks--subtasks]

### Data Models
- Blog entries reside under `website/src/content/blogs/{slug}.md` and expose the frontmatter fields `title`, `publishDate`, `tags`, `excerpt`, `heroImage`, and optional `externalUrl`; the implementation must read these without altering the schema. [Source: architecture/content-data-architecture.md#blogs]

### API Specifications
- No APIs are introduced for this story; all data access occurs through Astro’s `getCollection` over Markdown content.

### Component Specifications
- `/writing` listing and detail pages must be placed under `website/src/pages/` per the routing plan, leveraging the shared layout and partials to keep DOM structure consistent. [Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#routing-plan]
- Interactive filters should be built as Astro component islands (e.g., `BlogFilters.astro`) hydrating only the UI controls per the component islands guidance. [Source: architecture/technology-stack-decisions.md#technology-stack-decisions]
- Post templates should incorporate CTA and pull-quote blocks that align with the tone/structure captured in Story 1.0’s copy guidelines. [Source: website/README.md#style--voice-guidelines]

### File Locations
- New pages belong in `website/src/pages/` with dynamic routes under nested directories, while any supporting client components should live under `website/src/components/`. [Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#routing-plan]
- Blog assets referenced in frontmatter should continue residing in `website/public/assets/blogs/` so Astro copies them verbatim during builds. [Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#asset-strategy]

### Testing Requirements
- Use Vitest for unit-level validation of filtering utilities/components and Playwright for end-to-end coverage of listing navigation and filter behavior. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
- Keep `npm run build` as part of the regression checks to catch schema or rendering regressions in the static pipeline. [Source: architecture/build-deployment-architecture.md#production-build-flow]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue running on Node 18+ with Astro, preserving existing CSS/JS during migration and avoiding schema changes to the content collections. [Source: architecture/technology-stack-decisions.md#technology-stack-decisions]
- Maintain current meta tags/structured data from the shared layout to avoid SEO regressions and prepare for future article-level enhancements. [Source: architecture/performance-seo-considerations.md#performance--seo-considerations]
- Reuse the incremental migration approach so the legacy site remains stable while the `/writing` route transitions. [Source: architecture/migration-strategy.md#migration-strategy]

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep new routing and components within the existing Astro boundary defined for `website/` to maintain compatibility with the legacy coexistence plan. [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#boundary-definition]
- No additional project structure guidance beyond the established Astro source and public directories was found in architecture docs.

### Testing
- Place Vitest specs under `website/src/components/__tests__/` or `website/tests/` and Playwright e2e specs under `website/tests/e2e/`, following the testing strategy recommendations. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
