# Story 1.0: Markdown Content Seeding & Authoring Workflow

## Status
Tentatively done (looks good)

## Story
**As a** site owner,
**I want** the existing and future portfolio content stored in structured Markdown collections,
**so that** upcoming Astro pages can render blogs and projects consistently without duplicating effort.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Content collection directories exist under `website/src/content/` for blogs and projects, following the frontmatter schemas defined in the architecture documentation.
2. Research is conducted on high-performing Medium posts in relevant topics to capture tone, structure, and voice guidelines for future blog content.
3. Research is conducted on comparable portfolio project case studies to define copywriting guidelines that keep project Markdown consistent and compelling.
4. Every legacy blog currently under `website/blogs/` is migrated into a Markdown file that preserves the original content and metadata (title, publish date, tags, excerpt, hero image when present).
5. Markdown entries are prepared for each legacy project showcased on the site, capturing summary, tech stack, description, gallery assets, and outbound links in the prescribed frontmatter.
6. Templates (or generators) are available for adding new blog and project Markdown files, ensuring future entries include all required frontmatter fields.
7. Contributor documentation describes the end-to-end process for adding or updating blog and project Markdown content, including where to place assets and how to validate frontmatter, and embeds the research-backed copy guidelines.
8. A validation step (script or documented checklist) is provided so authors can confirm new Markdown entries meet schema expectations before handoff to rendering stories.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 establishes the Astro project skeleton; ensure this story is sequenced after that setup so content collections land in the correct directories. `[Source: docs/stories/1.1.foundational-content-engine-ssg-setup.md#tasks--subtasks]`

### Data Models
- Blogs frontmatter must include `title`, `publishDate` (ISO), `tags`, `excerpt`, `heroImage`, and optional `externalUrl`; content body remains Markdown. `[Source: architecture/content-data-architecture.md#blogs]`
- Projects frontmatter must capture `title`, `role`, `tech`, `summary`, `description`, `gallery`, and `links` arrays for modal experiences. `[Source: architecture/content-data-architecture.md#projects]`

### API Specifications
- No API integrations are introduced in this story; rendering will be handled by Astro content collections. `[Source: architecture/system-architecture-overview.md#target-state-diagram-conceptual]`

### Component Specifications
- Future Astro pages will consume these collections to populate `/writing` and `/projects`, so ensure slugs and field names align with the upcoming routing plan. `[Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#routing-plan]`

### Content Voice Guidance
- Research outputs should document tone, structure, and differentiation points derived from Medium and portfolio benchmarking so future entries read professionally and consistently. `[Source: docs/prd/1-goals-and-background-context.md#goals]`

### File Locations
- Place Markdown collections under `website/src/content/{blogs,projects}` with supporting templates alongside; assets referenced by Markdown should live in `website/public/assets/...` to flow into `dist/`. `[Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#asset-strategy]`
- Authoring documentation updates belong in `website/README.md`, aligning with migration guidance for contributors. `[Source: architecture/migration-strategy.md#migration-strategy]`
- Capture the Medium/blog and project copy findings within the updated README (or a linked `docs/content-style-guide.md`) so contributors have easy access to the guidelines. `[Source: docs/prd/1-goals-and-background-context.md#goals]`

### Testing Requirements
- Post-migration, run `npm run build` to confirm Astro validates content schemas and outputs without errors once Story 1.1 tooling is in place. `[Source: architecture/build-deployment-architecture.md#production-build-flow]`
- Plan for future Playwright coverage that exercises generated listings once rendering stories land; no automated UI tests are required yet. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`
- Perform peer review (or stakeholder sign-off) on the compiled style guidance to ensure tone aligns with brand goals before rolling into README. `[Source: docs/prd/1-goals-and-background-context.md#goals]`

### Technical Constraints
- Continue using Markdown with YAML frontmatter managed by Node 18 via Astro content collections to stay aligned with the selected stack. `[Source: architecture/technology-stack-decisions.md#technology-stack-decisions]`
- Maintain existing asset URLs during migration to avoid SEO regressions or broken references. `[Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#compatibility-requirements]`
- Ensure analytics snippets remain untouched; this story only handles content sources. `[Source: architecture/observability-analytics.md#observability--analytics]`

### Project Structure Notes
- Content layer setup fulfils the first stage of the target architecture, enabling the build and presentation layers configured in Story 1.1 and beyond. `[Source: architecture/system-architecture-overview.md#target-state-diagram-conceptual]`
- Introduce Markdown collections before dynamic filtering stories (1.2+) so those efforts can focus on UI logic instead of data wrangling. `[Source: architecture/migration-strategy.md#migration-strategy]`

### Testing
- Currently no automated tests exist for content; once the Astro toolchain is available, integrate schema validation into CI to prevent malformed Markdown. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`
- Document manual review steps (render preview, spell-check) until automated content QA is defined in later stories. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`
