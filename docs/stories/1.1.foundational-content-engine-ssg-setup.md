# Story 1.1: Foundational Content Engine & SSG Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** site owner,
**I want** a modern static site generator integrated into my project,
**so that** future content additions and updates can be managed efficiently with Markdown.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A lightweight Static Site Generator (e.g., Eleventy, Astro) is installed and configured in the `website/` directory.
2. An `npm run build` script processes source files and outputs a static site to a `dist/` directory.
3. The `index.html` page is converted to use the SSG's templating system while maintaining its exact visual layout and functionality.
4. All existing CSS and JavaScript files are correctly integrated into the new build process.
5. All assets (fonts, images, icons) are correctly copied to the output directory.
6. The SSG provides a local development server via an `npm run dev` command.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No previous stories exist; this is the starting point for Epic 1.

### Data Models
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs for data models required by this story; Markdown collections begin in later stories. 

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs because this story does not introduce APIs.

### Component Specifications
- Base layout must encapsulate the current `<head>`, header, footer, and SEO tags to minimize duplication across future pages. `[Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#layout-extraction]`
- Initial Astro page mapping should include `/` and prepare for additional routes such as `/resume` and `/journey` in subsequent stories. `[Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#routing-plan]`

### File Locations
- Astro source belongs under `website/src/` with `layouts/`, `components/`, and `pages/` directories following Astro defaults. `[Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#boundary-definition]`
- Static assets should live in `website/public/` so Astro copies them verbatim into the build output. `[Source: architecture/application-architecture.md#asset-strategy]`

### Testing Requirements
- Execute `npm run build` during CI and locally to guard against regressions in the SSG pipeline. `[Source: architecture/build-deployment-architecture.md#production-build-flow]`
- Introduce Playwright or Cypress smoke tests once dynamic pages are available; track as a follow-up since no frameworks exist yet. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`

### Technical Constraints
- Adopt Astro on Node 18+ while retaining existing CSS and vanilla JS for compatibility during migration. `[Source: architecture/technology-stack-decisions.md#technology-stack-decisions]`
- Preserve current asset paths and meta tags to avoid SEO regressions during the transition. `[Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#compatibility-requirements]`
- Keep Plausible as the primary analytics integration when setting up the base layout. `[Source: architecture/observability-analytics.md#observability--analytics]`

### Project Structure Notes
- The Astro project must coexist with the legacy static files in `website/` so incremental migration remains possible. `[Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md#boundary-definition]`
- Follow the migration strategy checklist to ensure parity with the legacy `index.html` before removing the original file. `[Source: architecture/migration-strategy.md#migration-strategy]`
- This story activates the content and build layers outlined in the target architecture, creating the foundation required for upcoming Markdown-driven features. `[Source: architecture/system-architecture-overview.md#target-state-diagram-conceptual]`

### Testing
- Favor Vitest for unit-level coverage of future Astro utilities/components, storing specs under `website/src/__tests__/` or `website/tests/`. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`
- Plan Lighthouse CI integration once the Astro build stabilizes to monitor performance deltas. `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]`
