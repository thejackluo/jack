# problem
currently most of the web features look great and all, but on mobile, 
the journey page for some reason is not responsive at all even though 
it should be responsive in general (maybe look at mobile responsive stuff)

the project page is responsive but the spacing is slightly off center on some pixels 
(so perhaps always center thenm)

and the blogs page just doesn't work at all and overflow and shows the blogs above the footers
and most of the blogs are inaccessible with the thing, so perhaps a scroll container and no filter
for the mobile version to make life easier :/

also the buttons on the footer for the different pages are different sizes (index is a good regular size)
but blogs have very small button (perhaps because the css is not dealt with properly)

also another thing is, since the nav bar is smaller on mobile, its very ugly, i want a nicer menu for mobile
where its a hamburger menu and when you check on it, a cool icon menu pops up? like floating nav glassmorphism
instead.

so i want you to think about this, and try to make the website more mobile friendly
