# Performance & SEO Considerations
- Maintain existing `<meta>` tags and Open Graph data; enhance with structured JSON-LD for articles/projects once Markdown metadata available.
- Use Astroâ€™s image optimization for project galleries (Story 1.3) where beneficial.
- Ensure CSS remains split to avoid blocking; consider bundling vendor CSS via Astro if size becomes an issue.
