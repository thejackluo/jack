# 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
* To upgrade the static portfolio website into a dynamic content platform with a modern, single-page application (SPA) feel.
* Enable easy management of content (blogs, projects, timeline) via a Markdown-based workflow.
* Transition the styling system from manual CSS to Tailwind CSS for improved consistency and developer experience.
* Enhance the user experience with fluid navigation, subtle animations, and updated, professionally written copy.
* Establish a modern technical foundation that paves the way for a future migration to a framework like Next.js.

**Background Context:**
The current website is a classic HTML/CSS/JS build where content is manually coded, making updates difficult. This document outlines a two-epic plan to modernize the site. Epic 1 focuses on building the foundational content engine using a Static Site Generator (SSG). Epic 2 builds on that foundation to transform the UI/UX into a fluid, SPA-like experience with modern styling and refreshed content.
