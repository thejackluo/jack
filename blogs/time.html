                  <b>Introduction</b> <br />
                  This is a selection of discussions about space, time, and
                  philosophy underlying these principles. Over the course of
                  this year, we have engaged in hour-long discussions in an
                  attempt to understand the nature of our world and the
                  possibilities that lie beyond our imagination.
                </p>

                <h2>Space</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <b>Definition</b> <br />
                  Let’s start by defining what space is. The definition of space
                  is debated heavily by philosophers even to this day. There are
                  different schools of thoughts on what space is. Some people
                  believe space is just a construct of the universe. With this
                  definition, everything in the boundary of the observable
                  universe is considered space. Others believe that space is
                  relative of the different things that exists within. If there
                  is matter, then space is the construct in which the matter
                  resides.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>The universe</b> <br />
                  Many people believe that space is limited by the size of the
                  observable universe and that space is finite. But, the
                  observable universe is often misrepresented as the entire
                  universe when in reality, there could be more universe beyond
                  the observable universe. Indeed, there is a physical barrier
                  that prevents you from peering into the grander picture. But,
                  we don’t know the true scale of how big the universe is.
                </p>

                <p>From this, we can infer two possibilities.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>The universe is finite.</li>
                  <li>The universe is infinite.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  <b>Possibility 1</b> <br />
                  Let’s imagine possibility one, let’s say there is a true
                  boundary that separates the universe from everything else. In
                  this case, what is the construct outside of the universe? Is
                  it a location that it’s impossible for matter to exist
                  physically? Is it a pure vacuum with zero particles? In this
                  case, regardless of whether there is matter in the construct,
                  the construct still exist as an abstract concept. There is
                  nothing that stops space from extending out to infinity in all
                  dimensions (we will discuss more about dimensions below).
                  Space itself is infinite as a construct, the only thing that
                  makes it “finite” is our belief of what space should be.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Possibility 2</b> <br />
                  Let’s say that space is infinite in all directions, that means
                  that no matter how far you go, you will always find more space
                  ahead of you. But theoretically, let’s say you travel
                  infinitely far to the edge of the universe and teleports
                  outside the universe. Is the construct still considered space?
                  In fact, what if the universe that we know of is actually the
                  outskirt of another universe, and that universe is actually
                  considered space?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Implications</b> <br />
                  While debating the nature of space may not have much practical
                  meaning in our everyday lives, understanding how our world
                  shapes our biases towards the definition of space can provide
                  valuable insights into human nature. In essence, space could
                  be seen as encompassing everything that could ever possibly
                  exist — a universal set of all possibilities. Using this
                  definition, we can discuss some implications of infinite
                  space.
                </p>

                <h2>Dimensions</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We currently live in a three dimension world: there is height,
                  length, and width. But why three dimensions specifically? Why
                  not four, or five, or one hundred.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Before we answer this question, let’s ask another question:
                  how many dimensions are we really in, and how do we know? If
                  you start reflecting on this question, the first thing that
                  comes up is physical movement. Because we can move in three
                  directions physically, we are in three dimensions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But, is physical movement really the best way to define
                  dimensions. What if there is another dimension that you can
                  travel in, but the dimension is curled up infinitely small
                  that you cannot physically observe the changes. You can’t
                  physically move in that dimension, but surely some dimension
                  exists. What if the dimension is something you can’t move
                  physically, but something you can move mentally, like a
                  dimension for your consciousness.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We have so far shown that there is a possibility for different
                  types of dimensions. What about time? Many people consider
                  time to be a separate dimension. But time is a dimension that
                  we can’t control. In fact, if we treat time as a dimension,
                  what about other fundamental concepts like the average
                  temperature of the universe? The temperature is every changing
                  and maps the universe from one temperature to another, of
                  course it is something we can’t control, but isn’t it very
                  similar to time? With this interpretation, every parameter
                  that exists out there could be a dimension of itself, leading
                  to quadrillions, quintillions, and even more dimensions.
                </p>

                <h2>Time</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The prevailing consensus is that the universe began with a Big
                  Bang, and another widely accepted theory is that the universe
                  will eventually end as entropy increases towards infinity,
                  culminating in a state of total disorder. But what transpired
                  before the universe existed? Did time exist back then, and if
                  so, what did it signify? How quickly does time travel in
                  relation to all other possible entities?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Time, akin to space, can have multiple interpretations. One
                  such understanding is that time represents a relative ordering
                  of events that occur in the past, present, and future. In this
                  context, time is relative to the speed at which events
                  transpire. Theoretically, an entire universe could emerge and
                  vanish within a single second, with that brief moment
                  encompassing the formation of stars, civilizations, galaxies,
                  and other exotic matter. Similarly, conscious intelligent
                  systems might process events on a much longer timescale,
                  taking 10 billion years, for example, to process a single
                  thought. In this regard, our universe could be either the most
                  significant one by a large margin or merely a speck of dust
                  within a much grander construct.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, when did this concept of time start ticking? Most people
                  attribute the Big Bang as the genesis of everything, but what
                  about the time before the Big Bang? What occurred then? One
                  could always delve further back into the past, tracing it to
                  infinity. It is possible that absolutely nothing happened
                  during the infinite stretch of time that preceded the Big
                  Bang. Regardless, our understanding of what truly took place
                  remains limited. The more one contemplates the nature of space
                  and time, the more one realizes its vastness and our own
                  insignificance within the grand scheme of things. An
                  individual’s death may occur, but an infinite amount of time
                  remains for countless events to unfold. Time persists,
                  marching on forever. And yet, here you are, existing in the
                  present moment. What does this mean for you?
                </p>

                <h2>Existence</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  You are aware of your own existence. As you read this, you’re
                  living your life and engaging in activities that interest you.
                  This demonstrates that the probability of your existence is
                  non-zero, as you serve as a singular example amidst the
                  trillions or quadrillions of possible scenarios in which the
                  universe could have formed you.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We’ve previously established that both space and time can be
                  potentially infinite. Consequently, there are infinite ways
                  for events to unfold. Given a large enough expanse, it is
                  theoretically possible for you to exist in a different
                  position within the universe. The likelihood of your exact
                  existence is infinitesimally small, almost zero. However,
                  infinity multiplied by an extremely small number still results
                  in infinity. Theoretically, this implies that there are
                  infinite versions of you scattered throughout time and space.
                  In fact, you might exist in countless world lines: one where
                  you’re a national hero, another where you’re a ruthless
                  dictator, one in which you lead an ordinary life, and yet
                  another where you’re anything but normal.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the grand context of the universe, your life may seem
                  inconsequential, unlikely to have any lasting impact a billion
                  years from now. So why not take a chance? Why not ask out that
                  person you’ve been contemplating, explore new opportunities or
                  hobbies, and delve into the world around you, perhaps even
                  trying something unconventional? At the end of the day, your
                  awareness is limited to your current life, so why not strive
                  for the extraordinary?
                </p>

                <h2>Questions to ponder about (Bonus)</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  What is truly right and truly wrong? (At one point in time, we
                  didn’t believe in the existence of zero and negative numbers.
                  At another point in time, we believed that the sun revolved
                  around the earth. So are our current models empirically
                  correct?)
                </p>

                <p>
                  What happens after you die? (As much as I know, you are
                  probably born again into a different conscious system)?
                </p>

                <p>
                  How would language work in four dimensions? Would people speak
                  in 2 dimension sequences (like images)?
                </p>
