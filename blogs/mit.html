              <p>
                Prologue 03/14 (π day) is a big day for 45,000 people: it is the
                day when MIT decisions are coming out. On this day, almost
                43,000 of them are met with disappointment as they see the “We
                have regret to inform you…” on their screens. The letter was
                short, a block of text that seemingly “determine your future
                forever”. On that day, shattered dreams and broken hearts were
                the only companions of the thousands who dared to dream big,
                work hard, and hope for a better future, only to be crushed by a
                merciless letter that reduced their worth to a mere number on a
                page and their efforts to a fleeting memory of wasted youth. For
                many, college rejections are rejections that felt out of control
                for the first time: something that could happen even if they are
                perfect. Some people get over this quickly, while others take
                months, or even years. When I received these decisions letters.
                I felt lost, really lost. I was in a state of limbo, doing
                things for the sake of doing things. I wasn’t able to support my
                friends when I can, nor am I able to enjoy the things I used to
                enjoy. The rejection felt worse than any rejection I have
                received: it’s like a fire slowly cooking me away. No matter how
                much water I poured, the fire never subsided. But over time, I
                came to realize that college, and even a top-tier university
                like MIT, was not the only path to success. I realized that
                there are ways you can form a world class education wherever you
                go. In this blog, I will be exploring some ways you can reach
                your goals, pave your path to the dream you want to reach. This
                blog is dedicated for those who may be feeling the sting of
                rejection, they too can find solace in the fact that their
                future is not defined by any one institution, but rather by the
                limitless potential within themselves. Part 1: Take a walk with
                me. I invite you to take a virtual walk with me. Take a second
                and imagine a place you want to be. How about strolling through
                the park next door, basking in the freshness of the air? Or
                trekking up the hill to observe the birds chirping while
                overseeing the city? Alternatively, we could explore downtown, a
                vibrant hub for commerce and activity. If you’re not ready for a
                walk, we can chat anytime you feel like it. Ready? Then let’s
                start chatting. “What are five good things that happened today?”
                Take a moment to deeply reflect on the positive moments in your
                life. Have your answer? You may wonder why I asked this question
                in the first place. Well, I want to remind you of the importance
                of maintaining a positive mindset and gratitude for what you
                have. Even if you have access to a world-class education, it’s
                essential to be in the right frame of mind to make the most of
                it. If you’re constantly dwelling on past mistakes or regrets,
                you may fail to see the other good things in your life, which
                can also impact your ability to grow and learn even if you are
                at your dream school. Regardless of where you are, reflecting on
                the positive things also will put you in a better mood which is
                a prerequisite for receiving the world class education and
                growing as a person. Having a positive mindset also will prepare
                you well for the challenge. To obtain a MIT styled education,
                there are four things to consider. You should have an internet
                connection. You should have a drive to learn and curiosity about
                the world. You should surround yourself with great people. You
                should have an optimistic attitude. If you are reading this
                article, you already met requirement 1. We will explore point
                2–4 down below. Let’s dive in. Part 2: Drink from the right
                firehose When most people hear MIT, the first thing they think
                of is the academics. Many MIT students have to choose only 2
                things from sleep, social, or studying. No MIT students could
                claim that they haven’t pulled an all nighter. It is evident
                that the MIT curriculum is amongst some of the most rigorous in
                the US. In fact, learning from MIT has been described as
                “drinking from the firehose”. You can attempt to use the MIT
                firehose by soaking yourself in MIT open courseware. But
                choosing the right firehose is crucial to getting a great MIT
                education anywhere. Before you even consider the intensity of
                the firehose, make sure it aligns with your interests and goals.
                You don’t want to get soaked by a firehose that sprays mud when
                you were hoping for one that blasts bubble milk tea. When
                selecting a firehose, it’s important to recognize that there
                will be challenges no matter which one you choose. For example,
                if you choose the mathematics firehose, you may find yourself
                bombarded with abstract models and equations that require
                multiple passes to understand. If you choose the computer
                science firehose, you may spend hours debugging code. But
                despite these difficulties, immersing yourself in the right
                firehose can be a refreshing experience, much like getting
                soaked by a firehose can be invigorating. By understanding
                yourself and selecting the right firehose, you can overcome the
                challenges and come out feeling renewed and ready to take on the
                world. Now that you have firehoses readied up, how intense
                should the blast be? I hope you are not trying to blast yourself
                at max intensity. You will get really soaked and not enjoy the
                experience. It’s better to take incremental steps, start with a
                small spray, and gradually increase it as you feel comfortable.
                It’s like adjusting the temperature of a shower. Adjusting it
                too fast might be a shock to your system. So, take the time to
                adjust it properly. Well, now you have some firehoses, go ahead
                and start blasting and remember to keep blasting consistently at
                a rate you enjoy. Part 3: A ripple of kindness If you ask any
                MIT students what their favorite part of MIT is, they are most
                likely going to mention “the people”. This may come as a
                surprise since most people attribute MIT with its academic
                workload. But in fact, the reason why MIT education is awesome
                is the people behind the institution: the professor, students,
                and necessary workers who keep the system running. One of the
                things MIT fosters a lot is collaboration. MIT will give you
                some of the most difficult problem sets possible. But MIT will
                also provide you with the best resources to tackle these problem
                sets, one of which is other peers. In fact, most problems in the
                world are solved by teams of people. If you want to change the
                world, you most likely will need a group of people supporting
                you. If you want to grow faster as a person, you will need
                mentors keeping you on track. If you want to think critically,
                you will need to discuss with colleagues with different
                perspectives than you. Having great people around you is one
                thing you can do to improve the environment around you. But how
                do you do this? It’s simple: start by doing random acts of
                kindness. These could be as small as cheering up someone’s day
                or as big as helping someone with their homework. The more you
                spread kindness, the more it radiates from within you, and
                people will begin to take notice. By this point, you will have
                developed a positive reputation and people will be more likely
                to engage with you. This will help you find the people with whom
                you resonate the most. Remember the overwhelming amount of
                knowledge you absorbed before from the firehose? The knowledge
                can also help spark conversation and engage in interesting
                conversation. Sooner or later, you will find yourself more
                engaged in the human experience and become like the awesome
                people you surrounded yourself with. Part 4: I hate this fu*king
                place / I have truly found paradise MIT’s environment can be
                summed up in one phrase: IHTFP (I have truly found paradise / I
                hate this fucking place). This is the mantra that MIT students
                live by. On one hand, they have found paradise, a place where
                they are surrounded by brilliant minds, state-of-the-art
                facilities, and an unending supply of opportunities to learn and
                grow. On the other hand, they hate this fucking place, with its
                relentless workload, sleepless nights, and unforgiving
                deadlines. Wherever you are in, it is a superposition of
                paradise or hell. This is true for all places. You will always
                find flaws in your environment and praising something else.
                While it is true that any environment can be seen as a mixture
                of paradise and hell, it is important to note that one’s
                attitude can greatly influence how they perceive and interact
                with their surroundings. Approaching your environment with
                boldness, spontaneity, and optimism can lead to a more positive
                experience, regardless of the challenges and stressors that may
                come with it. Being bold means taking risks and being unafraid
                to try new things. This attitude can help you make the most of
                your environment by seeking out new experiences and
                opportunities that may not have been immediately apparent. It
                can also help you overcome the fear of failure that often
                accompanies difficult tasks, allowing you to take on challenges
                with confidence and determination. Similarly, spontaneity can
                help you approach your environment with an open mind and a
                willingness to adapt to changing circumstances. By embracing
                unpredictability and being flexible in your approach to
                problem-solving, you can find creative solutions to complex
                issues and make the most of the resources available to you.
                Finally, approaching your environment with optimism can help you
                maintain a positive outlook, even in the face of adversity. By
                focusing on the potential for growth and learning, you can turn
                even the most challenging situations into opportunities for
                personal development and improvement. In short, while any
                environment may have its challenges and drawbacks, a positive
                attitude can help you make the most of the opportunities
                available to you. By being bold, spontaneous, and optimistic,
                you can approach your surroundings with a sense of adventure and
                curiosity, allowing you to grow and thrive in even the most
                difficult of circumstances. Conclusion Getting an MIT-style
                education is no easy feat. But keep trying to embark on a
                rigorous, challenging, and rewarding journey. As they say at
                MIT, “Pain is just weakness leaving the body.” So go forth, and
                conquer the world!
