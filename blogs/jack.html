                  <b>Who was I?</b> <br />
                  You know, a long time ago, I was that kid who used to sit at
                  the computer in the library and play games. And many games did
                  I play! Minecraft, fake minecraft, all the io games possible.
                  I was that kid who would do everything to bypass adminstrator
                  perms, and install a whole operating system on the school
                  chromebook, just to enjoy a game. It's crazy how much I've
                  changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, I guess I'm still that kid, but I've changed a lot. Like
                  so much I couldn't even recognize myself. So this post is
                  dedicated to saving a record of myself on the internet. If
                  something ever happens, I hope you know my story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Where was I born?</b> <br />
                  Singapore lah.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in middle school?</b> <br />
                  Not much, I had a crush on a girl, and failed to get her
                  attention even with all the sour patch I sold. I tried to
                  become the "sour patch kid". Looking back, it's cringy lol. I
                  tried creating youtube videos but the qualities are that of a
                  middle schooler. I did first robotics which was fun. Oh and
                  mathcounts, for the three years I have been there, I somewhat
                  regret not trying hard enough, but I did appreciate going
                  through the contest, helped a lot with logical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in high school?</b> <br />
                  A bit more, I started to get into programming, and learned AP
                  CS from scratch because I couldn't get into the AP CS class
                  (grr my high school). I tried out for symphony for clarinet
                  and created some music.
                  <a
                    href="https://www.soundcloud.com/thejackluo"
                    class="a-underline"
                    >here</a
                  >
                  (the music is quite interesting to say the least).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I invested in both main stream crypto and sh*t coins for fun
                  and growth hacked a decent amount. I might have hit the limit
                  on free food (especially free tpumps lo) at some point. Built
                  an ebike from scratch with money I have earned. Once had an
                  organization with 30 members teaching others how to do non
                  profits and start ups (lol). Oh, I biked to many random
                  places, within 20 miles of school. Plans to bike from south
                  bay to sf one day (if anyone is down message me lol, we should
                  schedule a time).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in college?</b> <br />
                  Well I have started a hacker house in SF, dived into a 200ft
                  cave, and chilled in stanford conference rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>What do you think has changed?</b> <br />
                  A lot to be honest. Many people thinks nothing really changed,
                  but inside, I have changed way too much lol. I used to be
                  carefree and very extraverted, but now adopt an mixed
                  lifestyle. I care more about the world and enjoy the stories
                  more. I try to appreciate what I have right now and recognize
                  that I am not perfect. I try to do more and not get dejected
                  by failure.
