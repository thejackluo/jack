                <p>
                  Outside of work, I enjoy riding my electric unicycle to explore
                  the world, immersing myself to the Japanese language, and
                  reading great stories of humans in this world. My goal in this
                  world is to find fulfillment and seek all experiences, and help
                  others do the same. If you want to connect with me, feel free to
                  <a class="a-underline" href="mailto:jack@hexahacks.com">shoot me a message</a>,
                  I am looking forward for our exchange.
