## A dream and its chase

Have you ever wanted something so badly that you devoted your life to it?  That was me when I decided to leave a college where ambition felt scarce and lectures were filled with people who just wanted a degree【994911954314862†L42-L50】.  I ground through the hardest courses, ranked in the top five percent and even avoided relationships because I was singularly focused on transferring【994911954314862†L52-L56】.  I flew to San Francisco and Stanford to insert myself into communities that would stretch me【994911954314862†L58-L61】.

## Success?

My hard work paid off: I managed to secure a special status at MIT, enrolling in courses without yet earning a diploma【994911954314862†L64-L70】.  Suddenly I was in Boston, sitting in lecture halls and meeting incredible people【994911954314862†L72-L75】.  It looked like total success, but the first week taught me something else: when you think you have life figured out, you rediscover how large and confusing the world is【994911954314862†L74-L78】.  I went from setting curves to feeling like just another person.  Imposter syndrome crept in【994911954314862†L82-L107】.

## Meaning of life

After chasing one goal for a year, I realised that achieving it did not answer everything.  School teaches a simple path: college, high‑paying job, profit.  But in the real world, people leave high salaries and wealthy people regret choices【994911954314862†L119-L124】.  Money is important, but once you can cover your needs, what next?  During my first two weeks in Boston, I felt disoriented.  My world had been narrow; now there was too much interesting stuff and no clear compass【994911954314862†L124-L146】.

## The hidden side

Moving to a new city alone was hard.  I had no housing or support and slept on office floors and sofas for a week【994911954314862†L131-L137】.  Vending‑machine food and fatigue made it difficult to participate fully【994911954314862†L131-L138】.  I thought leaving my old college would be perfect, but I quickly realised how disorienting it can be to transition; there is always more “cool sh*t” than one person can handle【994911954314862†L140-L146】.

## Acceptance

Despite the hardship, I recognise that this is the path I chose and I am committed to it【994911954314862†L149-L152】.  After the initial shock, things get better: I met over twenty incredible people in a week and learned more than I would have in a quarter at my old school【994911954314862†L152-L154】.  Being accepted in a new community takes time; the first and second weeks are always the hardest.  Looking back at friends from elementary school, high school and my first college reminds me how far I have come【994911954314862†L158-L161】.  To everyone who supported me, thank you.  No success comes without suffering【994911954314862†L167-L168】.
