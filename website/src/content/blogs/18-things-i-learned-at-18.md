1. It's okay to leave relationships! Only stay in relationships that are mutually beneficial, awesome, and necessary!
2. Waking up early is one of the best ways to change your routine, lifestyle, and productivity.
3. When you turn 18, open a bank account, stocks account, and a crypto account. Start investing early so you can attain maximum return on investment.
4. There will constantly be failures coming to you! Embrace them, tackle them differently, take away their lesson, and most importantly, enjoy it while it lasts.
5. By looking at your past experiences, memories, life, journal, etc., you not only see the culmination of your life, but you also embrace the nostalgia of seeing how far you have come.
6. Leaving social media and having alone time gives tranquility to the chaotic life and extra time to reflect, pause, and ponder on your true desires.
7. The one thing not to procrastinate on is happiness. Unexpected things could happen at any moment, so enjoy your life to the fullest right now!
8. Don't give a damn about what people think about you. Chances are, they think about themselves more than they think about you.
9. Sometimes, there are windows of opportunity that only last for a short time. Take advantage of these times before they go by!
10. There are too many things in this world for you to do all of them. Time is limited so choose wisely!
11. Having great relationships with everyone is crucial to your well-being, success, and most importantly, your identity.
12. When you shed your past self, treat it like a new attempt at your dreams, goals, and challenges.
13. 10 years from now, you will be someone completely different through the tiny daily changes. It is your choice whom you want to be.
14. There are no right answers in life. That is why there are so many arguments, debates, etc.
15. Creativity is a time-consuming process, not something to be forced.
16. Do something you always wanted to do, right now! Don't wait.
17. Don't simply follow what others have done! For instance, the 18th thing is purposefully left blank for you to fill out.
18. ***
