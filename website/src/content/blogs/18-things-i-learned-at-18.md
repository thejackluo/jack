1. It's okay to leave relationships! Only stay in relationships
that are mutually beneficial, awesome, and necessary!

1. Waking up early is one of the best ways to change your
routine, lifestyle, and productivity.

1. When you turn 18, open a bank account, stocks account, and a
crypto account. Start investing early so you can attain
maximum return on investment.

1. There will constantly be failures coming to you! Embrace
them, tackle them differently, take away their lesson, and
most importantly, enjoy it while it lasts.

1. By looking at your past experiences, memories, life,
journal, etc., you not only see the culmination of your
life, but you also embrace the nostalgia of seeing how far
you have come.

1. Leaving social media and having alone time gives tranquility
to the chaotic life and extra time to reflect, pause, and
ponder on your true desires.

1. The one thing not to procrastinate on is happiness.
Unexpected things could happen at any moment, so enjoy your
life to the fullest right now!

1. Don't give a damn about what people think about you. Chances
are, they think about themselves more than they think about
you.

1. Sometimes, there are windows of opportunity that only last
for a short time. Take advantage of these times before they
go by!

1. There are too many things in this world for you to do all of
them. Time is limited so choose wisely!

1. Having great relationships with everyone is crucial to your
well-being, success, and most importantly, your identity.

1. When you shed your past self, treat it like a new attempt at
your dreams, goals, and challenges.

1. 10 years from now, you will be someone completely different
through the tiny daily changes. It is your choice whom you
want to be.

1. There are no right answers in life. That is why there are so
many arguments, debates, etc.

1. Creativity is a time-consuming process, not something to be
forced.

1. Do something you always wanted to do, right now! Don't wait.

1. Don't simply follow what others have done! For instance, the
18th thing is purposefully left blank for you to fill out.
