## Dear Jack

It has been thirty‑five years since I last saw you.  By now you have lived seven different lives, each marked by its own projects and experiments.  The person who writes this letter has built the first commercially available robot that can understand and respond to human emotions, and a quantum computing algorithm that helps artificial intelligence simulate moral reasoning.  You have also spent years designing a new city with decentralised governance and universal basic income so people can unleash their creativity without being shackled by mundane tasks.

## What I want you to know

You will experience the deepest despair and the highest excitement.  No matter how you feel today, remember that being alive is rare and precious.  There has never been a day exactly like this before.  Take pride in the story you are creating.  Use your gifts to improve other people's lives and find your own purpose.  The letter closes with love from your sixty‑year‑old self, who hopes you will make the most of the path ahead.
