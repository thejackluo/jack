## Introduction

Inspired by a lecture from investor Graham Weaver, I started to explore the idea of living multiple “lives” within one.  Rather than waiting for the perfect moment, I decided to try on nine identities over the next few years and see which ones give me energy and purpose【901146759789380†L36-L41】.  Here are the first five.

## 1. The life of a creator

Being a content creator isn’t about fame; it is about experiencing the world through stories and dialogue.  I want to talk to people from every walk of life, reflect their joys and struggles and amplify hope【901146759789380†L44-L57】.  After spending too much time focused on negative news, I want to shift my lens toward light and community.

## 2. The life of a voyager

This life is about rockets, planes and the dream of reaching other planets.  I imagine humanity becoming an interstellar civilisation and feel a deep desire to help build the vehicles that will take us there【901146759789380†L60-L73】.  Exploration and engineering go hand in hand; awe fuels innovation.

## 3. The life of an architect of intelligence

I want to dive deep into artificial intelligence and design systems that make people’s lives better.  The goal isn’t to replace humans but to elevate them, automating the tedious so we can focus on creativity and agency【901146759789380†L75-L87】.  Building AI that respects human values is one of the most important pursuits I can imagine.

## 4. The life of a world‑builder

Games and virtual worlds let us test possibilities.  I dream of creating entire landscapes, cultures and systems that stretch the imagination.  World‑building is not just play; it is research into what could be【901146759789380†L90-L103】.

## 5. The life of service

The fifth life is grounded in compassion.  I want to help orphans, underserved children and anyone whom life has stacked the odds against.  There is immense joy in giving someone hope and tangible change【901146759789380†L105-L116】.  Scaling kindness is as ambitious as scaling technology.

## Conclusion

This is only part one of my nine‑life experiment.  Each archetype is an invitation to act, not a fantasy to daydream about.  By living them, even briefly, I hope to discover which paths resonate most and why.
