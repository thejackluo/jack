## Section 1 – It begins when you are born

Many of us who end up in quirky subcultures did not quite fit in growing up.  Whether we were exceptionally intellectual, neurodivergent or simply weird, our formative years came with a feeling of otherness.  That creates a deep yearning to find people who resonate on the same frequency.  When we arrive at a place like MIT's East Campus, we recognise each other instantly and bond over shared experiences.  Psychologists call this homophily: the tendency to associate with people like ourselves.

## Section 2 – Self‑selection into an ingroup

Some institutions allow students to choose their living environments.  At MIT, for example, the housing lottery lets you opt into a culture like East Campus.  This self‑selection leads to distinct communities with their own identities and traditions.  Roughly one quarter prefer conventional dorms, another quarter gravitate toward quirky environments and the rest identify as overachievers with varied interests.  Finding others who share your background or interests creates an immediate and powerful connection, fuelling a feedback loop of deeper immersion.  Suddenly you are filling a room with plastic balls, building ziplines in a dorm or syncing lights to music because someone said "why not?"

## Section 3 – The dark side of immersion

Every bubble has its limits.  The beauty of places like East Campus is that they allow people to flourish, but the deeper you get, the harder it is to leave.  Some linger for years because the environment offers instant connection.  When your identity is tied to a group, change feels threatening and newcomers struggle to break in.  If you never venture beyond the ingroup, the culture can become an echo chamber.  The best people know when to move on and apply what they have learned elsewhere.

## Section 4 – Why this topic?

I wrote this because I have a soft spot for MIT—not because of its academics but because of the people.  I have moved four times in college and have been searching for a place to call home.  Communities like East Campus taught me how powerful shared culture can be, but they also showed me the importance of building a world where people naturally come together without getting stuck.  My goal is to create a garden that attracts butterflies rather than chase them.  Travelling and meeting diverse people reminds me how big and beautiful the world is and inspires me to contribute to something better.
