## Introduction

What makes a great first hire? And how should we think about a world that will look radically different two decades from now? Drawing inspiration from **Zero to One** and my own experience, this piece outlines the qualities to look for in early employees and the forces that will shape the future of technology and work.

## Four traits of a day‑zero hire

1. **Independent thinking and initiative** – Early employees cannot rely on standard procedures; they must navigate uncertainty, intuit the next step and challenge the founder when necessary.
2. **Hard work and resilience** – Startup life includes 3 AM customer calls and existential crises. The first hires must be willing to lean in without burning out.
3. **Mission alignment** – Velocity matters more than starting point. Someone who believes deeply in the mission will outpace someone who is merely exceptional.
4. **Team alignment** – Over a third of companies fail due to co‑founder or team issues. If a new hire could be easily swapped without changing the group dynamic, you may not have found the right fit.

## Looking twenty years ahead

Thinking about the next two decades is more than a thought experiment; it is necessary for building something that endures. AI progress currently hinges on a few centralized companies with vast resources. Without new antitrust measures, those giants may continue to dominate. To "beat Google" or any incumbent you would need to offer a service that is ten times better across network effects, brand and technical excellence. Consider how network effects and capital shape your strategy, and remember that the best way to prepare for the future is to hire people who can adapt as it unfolds.
