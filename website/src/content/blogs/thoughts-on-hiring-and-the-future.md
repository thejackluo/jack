## Introduction

What makes a great first hire?  And how should we think about a world that will look radically different two decades from now?  Drawing inspiration from **Zero to One** and my own experience, this piece outlines the qualities to look for in early employees and the forces that will shape the future of technology and work【814955582398751†L36-L43】.

## Four traits of a day‑zero hire

1. **Independent thinking and initiative** – Early employees cannot rely on standard procedures; they must navigate uncertainty, intuit the next step and challenge the founder when necessary【814955582398751†L51-L67】.  
2. **Hard work and resilience** – Startup life includes 3 AM customer calls and existential crises.  The first hires must be willing to lean in without burning out【814955582398751†L86-L96】.  
3. **Mission alignment** – Velocity matters more than starting point.  Someone who believes deeply in the mission will outpace someone who is merely exceptional【814955582398751†L99-L113】.  
4. **Team alignment** – Over a third of companies fail due to co‑founder or team issues.  If a new hire could be easily swapped without changing the group dynamic, you may not have found the right fit【814955582398751†L119-L121】.

## Looking twenty years ahead

Thinking about the next two decades is more than a thought experiment; it is necessary for building something that endures.  AI progress currently hinges on a few centralized companies with vast resources【814955582398751†L136-L143】.  Without new antitrust measures, those giants may continue to dominate.  To “beat Google” or any incumbent you would need to offer a service that is ten times better across network effects, brand and technical excellence【814955582398751†L146-L150】.  Consider how network effects and capital shape your strategy, and remember that the best way to prepare for the future is to hire people who can adapt as it unfolds.
