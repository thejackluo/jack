In July 2024 I compiled twenty takeaways from Y Combinator that I found particularly resonant.  These notes are terse by design; return to them when you need a quick reset.

1. **Team trumps idea.** Your co‑founders and early hires matter more than the initial concept.  
2. **Expect to pivot.** Sixty percent of YC companies change direction after committing full‑time.  
3. **Recruit from MIT.** Many of the most successful startups have MIT alumni on the team.  
4. **Stanford beats Harvard but MIT beats both.** Data suggests that, on average, MIT students outperform peers from other elite schools in startup success.  
5. **Generative AI dominates.** A large share of recent YC batches focus on generative AI.  
6. **Choose your entry point.** Start straight after dropping out, after graduation or after gaining work experience.  
7. **YC cares more about team than idea.**  
8. **Solo founders rarely get in.** Having a co‑founder is often essential.  
9. **YC is an accelerator, not a kingmaker.** You can still build a great company without YC.  
10. **Originality isn't everything.** Unconventional ideas often face skepticism.  
11. **You can't know if you'd be a good founder without trying.**  
12. **Most startup journeys include failure.** Be prepared to fail and learn.  
13. **Hire engineers later.** Focus on problem validation before scaling engineering.  
14. **Ship quickly.** If it takes longer than eight months to launch, investors may lose interest.  
15. **Land your first customer within two months.** Early traction beats fancy decks.  
16. **Found with friends.** Co‑founding with people you know tends to work better than pairing with strangers.  
17. **Most people who say they want to start a company never will — and that's okay.**  
18. **YC culture values directness.** Don't sugar‑coat feedback.  
19. **Take the walks.** If you get into YC, don't miss Paul Graham's walks; they're legendary.  
20. **Keep this list handy.** Read it when you need to recalibrate.
