In July 2024 I compiled twenty takeaways from Y Combinator that I found particularly resonant.  These notes are terse by design; return to them when you need a quick reset【772938094626183†L36-L39】.

1. **Team trumps idea.** Your co‑founders and early hires matter more than the initial concept【772938094626183†L40-L41】.  
2. **Expect to pivot.** Sixty percent of YC companies change direction after committing full‑time【772938094626183†L41-L43】.  
3. **Recruit from MIT.** Many of the most successful startups have MIT alumni on the team【772938094626183†L43-L48】.  
4. **Stanford beats Harvard but MIT beats both.** Data suggests that, on average, MIT students outperform peers from other elite schools in startup success【772938094626183†L44-L48】.  
5. **Generative AI dominates.** A large share of recent YC batches focus on generative AI【772938094626183†L49-L50】.  
6. **Choose your entry point.** Start straight after dropping out, after graduation or after gaining work experience【772938094626183†L50-L51】.  
7. **YC cares more about team than idea.**  
8. **Solo founders rarely get in.** Having a co‑founder is often essential【772938094626183†L52-L54】.  
9. **YC is an accelerator, not a kingmaker.** You can still build a great company without YC【772938094626183†L54-L56】.  
10. **Originality isn’t everything.** Unconventional ideas often face skepticism.  
11. **You can’t know if you’d be a good founder without trying.**  
12. **Most startup journeys include failure.** Be prepared to fail and learn【772938094626183†L57-L60】.  
13. **Hire engineers later.** Focus on problem validation before scaling engineering【772938094626183†L61-L63】.  
14. **Ship quickly.** If it takes longer than eight months to launch, investors may lose interest【772938094626183†L62-L63】.  
15. **Land your first customer within two months.** Early traction beats fancy decks【772938094626183†L64-L65】.  
16. **Found with friends.** Co‑founding with people you know tends to work better than pairing with strangers【772938094626183†L65-L67】.  
17. **Most people who say they want to start a company never will — and that’s okay.**【772938094626183†L67-L68】  
18. **YC culture values directness.** Don’t sugar‑coat feedback【772938094626183†L69-L70】.  
19. **Take the walks.** If you get into YC, don’t miss Paul Graham’s walks; they’re legendary【772938094626183†L69-L71】.  
20. **Keep this list handy.** Read it when you need to recalibrate.
