## Introduction

I keep a dream journal because my morning brain likes to pretend the night was just noise.  Those messy notes, written half awake, remind me who I said I wanted to be when I was too tired to perform【713383338430219†L36-L48】.  In this essay I turn three recurring dreams into three simple rules for living.

## Dream one – Sparks

In the first dream I am on a quiet street when a dog lunges through a gate and knocks my father down.  I reach for him but hesitate; each repeat of the scene shows me how my delay makes a minor incident dangerous【713383338430219†L56-L74】.  The lesson is not dramatic heroism—it is five seconds.  Step in earlier.  Whether it is helping a friend, answering a hard message or starting a project, the difference between pain and progress is often a tiny moment of action.

## Dream two – Trains and vending machines

The second dream shifts to Chongqing‑like hills and a perfectly on‑time train.  Later I wander a lab, meet old friends and watch fireworks fizzle under benches【713383338430219†L96-L137】.  In a glass office I reach into what looks like a fridge but the machine dispenses lighters and fireworks instead of food【713383338430219†L126-L137】.  It makes me laugh and wince: I say I want nourishment but I keep picking sparks.  The rule here is to choose real fuel over flashy distractions.  Take the train instead of the slot machine.  Make the call instead of scrolling.

## Dream three – Shields

The final dream is a road trip.  After hours of driving a girl greets me and says simply, “I like you; let’s talk more.”【713383338430219†L159-L165】  A stranger hands me the keys to a car and hints at an unspoken price【713383338430219†L166-L172】.  I return the keys, knock on a heavy unmarked door and state what I want.  The door opens without applause【713383338430219†L174-L179】.  This dream teaches me to distinguish gifts that shrink me from support that expands me and to ask cleanly for what I need.

## Methods and practice

At the end of my notes I lay out a simple method: catch one detail before your phone tells you who to be, then make a small change you will still feel at night.  Every evening I ask three questions: did I step in early or wait; did I choose nourishment over sparks; did I model the pause I want others to take【713383338430219†L188-L194】.  Most days I miss something, but the loop stays short so I can try again without turning my life into a performance【713383338430219†L188-L200】.  The page remembers; the work earns tomorrow.
