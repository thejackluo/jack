**How did this start?**

It all started in a small twitter post made by
[@kevinzhangkjz](https://twitter.com/kevinzhangkjz/status/1648569715063676928)
on twitter. I have interacted with Kevin a few times through
twitter comments, but not officially talked until this tweet.
I consider this to be the catalyst of the whole hacker house.

I originally reached out not because I had the exact need to
live in the bay area at that time. But I believe that this
conversation could lead to something great. At that time, I
had no expectation at all that the house was going to grow to
the point today. It was merely me and Kevin.

Ivan also reached out ______

**Where did the other people come from?**

Online lol.

**What was the composition of the house?**

The house was a 3 story house with 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.
The frst floor was 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The second
floor was the living room, kitchen, and a huge "makeshift
bedroom". The third floor was the rooftop with clear views of
the central financial district. The house was located in the
middle of the city, which was very convenient for us to get to
places.

**Sh*t that happened in the hacker house**

Coworking Berkeley Poker night Establishment of two new
companies

**Any updates right now?**
