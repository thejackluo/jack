The Q Hacker House brought together ten founders, researchers, and makers under one roof for a three-week sprint on ambitious projects with built-in accountability.

## Highlights

- Converted a downtown SF loft into a co-living lab with dedicated coworking areas, demo day setups, and quiet zones — enabling the team to focus and ship without life friction.
- Scheduled nightly salon talks featuring visiting founders and domain experts, plus weekend field trips around the Bay Area that sparked new collaborations.
- Embedded Prodicity's AI mentorship track for high school builders, pairing each resident with remote mentees (20+ students total) and integrating mentorship into the house's daily rhythm.
- Several prototype products and research projects were born or advanced significantly during the program, and one became the foundation for the Prodicity mentorship platform after the house ended.

## Personal Contribution

I ran the end-to-end logistics and program design — from leasing and furnishing the space, to budgeting meals and events, to curating the guest speakers. I was essentially the glue connecting residents, mentors, and external partners. Whether it was resolving last-minute housing issues or facilitating a brainstorming session at midnight, I made sure the environment enabled everyone to do their best work. The experience also taught me how a tight-knit, high-energy community can 10x the progress of individuals, something I carry into team-building in other projects.
