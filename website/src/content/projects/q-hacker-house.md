The Q Hacker House brought together ten founders, researchers, and makers under one roof to sprint on ambitious projects with accountability baked in.

## Highlights
- Converted a downtown SF loft into a co-living lab with coworking, demo, and quiet zones so the team could ship without friction.
- Scheduled nightly salons featuring visiting founders, and facilitated weekend field trips that sparked new collaborations.
- Embedded Prodicity's AI mentorship track for high school builders, pairing residents with 20+ mentees remotely.

## Personal Contribution
I ran the end-to-end logistics—from leasing and furnishing, to budgeting meals and events—and acted as the connective tissue between residents, mentors, and external partners.
