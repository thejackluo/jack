Calend.ai began as a lightweight experiment to eliminate the friction of context switching into calendar UI. The extension listens for quick prompts ("hold office hours next Friday"), expands them with learned preferences, and syncs directly into Google Calendar.

## Highlights
- Adaptive prompt templates that adjust tone, location, and reminders based on prior edits.
- Uses semantic embeddings to match recurring meeting intents with the right attendees and conferencing links.
- Ships with a safety layer that surfaces diffs before submission so users stay in control of changes.

## Personal Contribution
I owned the product direction, system design, and end-to-end implementationâ€”from Chrome extension scaffolding and Google OAuth flows to the LLM prompt strategy that personalizes event drafts over time.
