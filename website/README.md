# Github Repo Name: jack  
Hello everyone, this is the fourth iteration of my personal website.  
Everything is open source and free to use, just remember to contact me for author permission  
Current version: 4.3.2 (planning to create a basic update log for the website).

# What is this project about?  
This is the most up-to-date version of my [personal website](https://jack-luo.com)!  
It details my progress with discovering life, blogs, and (in the future) projects. My goal for this website is to capture who I am as a person and create a space with freedom to explore how to best arrange visual content!! 
This website is going to be a continuous process. My next steps is to put more blogs in!
