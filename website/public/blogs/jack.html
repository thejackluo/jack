                  <b>Who was I?</b><br />
                  You know, a long time ago, I was that kid who used to sit at the computer in the library and play games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And many games did I play. Minecraft, fake Minecraft, every io game on those sketchy websites. I was that kid who would do anything to bypass administrator perms, the one trying to install a whole operating system on a school Chromebook just to enjoy a game at 3 pm on a Tuesday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is crazy how much I have changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, technically I am still that kid. I just upgraded the operating system in my head. So this post is dedicated to saving a record of myself on the internet. If something ever happens, I want there to be at least one place that explains what happened in my brain.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Where was I born?</b><br />
                  Singapore lah.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then life did its thing and I ended up bouncing between Singapore and different parts of the world, eventually landing in California and later on in a mess of colleges, hacker houses and random cities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in middle school?</b><br />
                  Not much, but also kind of a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had a crush on a girl and tried to win her over by selling Sour Patch to everyone. I basically tried to become the "Sour Patch kid". It did not work. Looking back, it is cringy lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I made YouTube videos with the production quality of a microwave. I did FIRST Robotics which was actually fun. I also did MathCounts for three years. I regret not trying harder, but going through those contests did a lot for my logic and pattern recognition brain.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in high school?</b><br />
                  A bit more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Got into programming and self studied AP CS because I could not get into the official AP CS class (grr my high school).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tried out for symphony on clarinet, made some questionable music and some pretty interesting pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Went down the crypto rabbit hole, from mainstream coins to complete garbage tokens for fun and learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Abused free food events and probably hit the limit on free tpumps at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Built an e bike from scratch using money I actually earned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ran an "organization" with around 30 members teaching people how to do nonprofit and startup projects. It was chaotic but fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Biked to random places within about 20 miles of school, with a dream of biking from South Bay to San Francisco one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Basically, I was half nerd, half feral, fully online.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>What did I do in college?</b><br />
                  Short answer: a lot, in a very nonlinear way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Longer answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Went through multiple schools, including UC campuses and then Georgia Tech for AI and embedded systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spent time at MIT as a "special student" kind of situation where I audited classes, hung out in makerspaces and pretended I lived there more than I technically did.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Started and stayed in hacker houses in San Francisco and other cities, trying to create high energy environments where people actually build things instead of just talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Started an SF hacker house, dived into a 200 foot cave, and somehow ended up chilling in Stanford conference rooms like that was normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Built and shipped multiple AI projects, including productivity tools, trading bots and energy optimization systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  College for me has never been just "go to lecture, go home". It is been more like "use the school as an excuse to do insane side quests".
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>What do you think has changed?</b><br />
                  Honestly, a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the outside, people sometimes think I am basically the same. Inside, it feels like I have lived three or four different lives already.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used to be carefree and super extroverted. Now my lifestyle is mixed. I still like chaos, but I think more about long term things. I care more about the world, about stories, about how people end up where they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am more aware of my flaws. I try to appreciate what I have instead of obsessing over what I do not. I try to do more and get less destroyed by failure. That does not mean I always succeed at that, but at least I know the game I am playing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>How do you define true happiness?</b><br />
                  Do the things you actually want to do, as long as they stay within the law and your own values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you can look at what you are doing and say "yeah, this lines up with what I believe", you are already far ahead of most people.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Predetermined or free will?</b><br />
                  Predetermined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is against human ego to accept that, but I lean toward the idea that a lot of things are set up by initial conditions, environment and probabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You still have to act like you have free will though, otherwise it gets dark fast.
                </p>

                      <p>Because I wasted a lot of time.</p>
                      <p>I know what it feels like to be smart enough to do something big and still lose whole years to procrastination, distraction and fear. Productivity, for me, is not about "grind harder". It is about designing a life where important things actually get done without burning out or becoming a robot.</p>

                      <p>No. It came later.</p>
                      <p>Energy started mattering when I realized how much compute, AI and data centers are constrained by boring physical things like grid capacity, transmission, and regulations. Efficore exists because someone has to actually solve that bottleneck.</p>
                      <p>So now I care a lot about the intersection of AI, energy and infrastructure.</p>

                      <p>Yes, sort of.</p>
                      <p>I spent a year around MIT, auditing classes, participating in clubs and hanging out in makerspaces. Some of it was formally allowed, some of it was just me walking in and sitting down.</p>

                      <p>Because environment is OP.</p>
                      <p>In a good hacker house, the default state is "building something" instead of "scrolling something". People cook, code, argue, break things, and occasionally touch grass together. You cannot really replicate that energy alone in a dorm.</p>
                      <p>I started and helped run hacker houses because I wanted that density of weird, ambitious people in real life, not just on Twitter.</p>

                      <p>Dreams for me are like compressed story files. They mix childhood, current stress, future fears and random symbols into strange but meaningful images. I do not think they are magic, but I do think they are a very fast way to see what your subconscious is obsessing over.</p>
