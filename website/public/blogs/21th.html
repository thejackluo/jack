                <p>
                  Take a moment, I want you to look around and observe your
                  environment. Whether it be the desk you are doing work on, or
                  the bed you are laying on, or the infrastructure beside you.
                  Let’s say I give you 10 years of uninterrupted, independent
                  time. Would you be able to build that thing?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Most infrastructure or material items you see around us
                  nowadays is a culmination of the work that the human race has
                  put in years, and years of effort to ideate, create, refine,
                  and repeat. Almost everything you have, takes an unbelievable
                  amount of work to create. The fact that we have all of these
                  things is simply amazing!
                </p>

                <p>
                  I want to take you through a journey today to the beginning of
                  time (as we know it). Our story started a long, long time ago,
                  way before we could imagine. But we really became human when
                  we mastered the control for fire 3 million years ago. I will
                  define this the beginning of human race (although there is no
                  consensus on when we become human, so take this with a grain
                  of salt).
                </p>

                <p>
                  For 2.99 million of these years, here is what happened each
                  day for us humans. We wake up, went hunting consistently in
                  the morning, then the afternoon. And depending on what we get,
                  we have one meal at the end of the day. There was no
                  consistent sleep schedule for humans back them as we had to be
                  alert of any predators or natural dangers. Nighttime is
                  especially dangerous as the coldness wore down the human body
                  (there is no blankets to keep you warm or Netflix to entertain
                  you back them). In fact, nothing that even remotely resembles
                  modern tech existed back them. That is simply bonkers to think
                  about today (2.99 million years is a long time).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Out of the remaining 4%, a huge chunk of the period (99.5%)
                  was humans going out to fields in difficult conditions every
                  day to work on fields with almost no rest. Laws were
                  extraordinarily harsh and are inconceivable in today’s time.
                  There was almost nothing that was ever too interesting.
                  Scientific discoveries were slow as even a small discovery in
                  a lifetime will be significant. When you are born, you will
                  pretty much die very close by to where you are born. Your role
                  is also assigned at birth with no room for change. It is
                  almost expected that you will never see change.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Take a moment and just imagine all of these humans. Around 90
                  billion of them, had to live out their lives without any
                  expectations of anything, with almost no change by today’s
                  standards but built the foundations of what there is today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We are now arriving at an inconceivably small period, a time
                  that still seems like ages. The last 500 years of human
                  history up to this point, was still extremely static. There
                  were a lot more activities that have happened at this time
                  including new scientific discoveries and movements, but
                  nowhere to the scale of the last 100 years. People for the
                  most part still lived in tents, small dirt houses, without
                  anything of particular interest. 99% of the things we see
                  around us today don’t exist at that time. People who lived 200
                  years ago still in large part lived in ancient society almost,
                  with no change to the agriculture model and lack of social
                  mobility. They never learned what we have learned so much of
                  at all. All they can hope for is to keep working, just for a
                  future, where potentially, things will become more
                  comfortable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Hundreds of generations of humans, just working, so hard, with
                  no change in 99% of them. But they never gave up. No matter
                  how tough these conditions were, they kept grinding, and
                  progress was finally observed slightly. Throughout all of
                  these times, wars have been constant and people died in so
                  many different ways. The sufferings from diseases were
                  numerous. Life was miserable in many ways. Imagine what people
                  back then could have done with the scientific knowledge we had
                  today?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Evidently, in these 500 years, really only around 10% of the
                  people in the past 50 years can experience even remotely the
                  lives we have today. After so many iterations, people grinding
                  for their lives. We finally have arrived at a time where we
                  could talk about a time where things were so much more
                  enhanced. These are the people we could interact with like
                  parents, grandparents, middle-aged people, etc. But even then,
                  there are so many struggles they had. A lot of countries were
                  still very unstable, wars still existed a lot. Technology
                  still wasn’t developed enough for the most part. Even though
                  their lifestyles were somewhat similar to ours today. There is
                  so much, they just didn’t have.
                </p>

                <p>
                  And only then, do we reach today. After all the zooming in,
                  the scrolling of the history, we reached a period where we
                  live. The whole modern human history, a period of 200,000
                  years, is still only 0.1% of dinosaur history. Imagine that
                  for a moment. Everything we ever knew about, all these
                  sufferings, everything the humans ever built, it is such an
                  insignificant time that it might as well not matter. Earth
                  existed for 20,000 times longer than that and went through so
                  many changes. Comparing the magnitude is like comparing a
                  short day to the entire human lifetime.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The things we have today are honestly, beautiful. Look around
                  you. Everything around you is the cumulation of years of work
                  by the past generations of humans. The food we eat is honestly
                  awesome. The choices we have are honestly endless. The
                  environment we live in feels very comfortable. Air condition
                  makes an environment feel very comfortable. We get to
                  experience entertainment so addicting that it changes the
                  wiring of our brain. All the information humans have gathered
                  for thousands and tens of thousands of years. Are all in one
                  place online. This piece you are reading right now is in a
                  place that none of the 98% of humans ever existed was ever
                  experienced in their entire lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The world is in the most peaceful era nowadays with the least
                  amount of wars. The technology we get to witness is honestly
                  so awesome, so many humans were never able to experience it,
                  they have to work and work every day without the expectation
                  of seeing it. Imagine the millions of slaves farming land, the
                  tens of billions of people before us, building up the
                  evolution of humans, changing our biology to what it is today.
                  The possibilities of what you can do today are endless. There
                  are so many things
