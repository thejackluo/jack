This is the fourth iteration of my Personal Website.  
Everything is open source and free to use, just remember to contact me if you wish to use this website to incur a profit!
Current version: 4.3.1 (planning to create a basic update log for the website).

# What is this project about?  
This is the most up-to-date version of my [personal website](https://jack-luo.com)!  
It details my progress with discovering life, blogs, and (in the future) projects. My goal for this website is to capture who I am as a person and create a space with freedom to explore how to best arrange visual content!! 
This website is going to be a continuous process. My next steps is to put more blogs in!

# Future Updates  
- A better rendition of the journey section. Especially showing the projects (DONE)
- More blogs on the website (hosted natively) (WIP)
- Convert to Next.js (WIP)
