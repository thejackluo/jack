# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the feature design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks focused on Phase 1: Static Site Migration with Performance Focus. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, following test-driven development principles and addressing critical bugs identified in the codebase analysis.

**Development Approach**: Systematic and methodical - assume all existing components are broken until proven working through comprehensive testing.

## Current Status Assessment

### üîÑ Partially Complete (Need Fixes)

- **Hero Section**: Layout exists but has spacing gaps that need adjustment
- **Navigation**: Functional but has glitchy behavior and mobile menu missing
- **Footer**: Icons present but too large and black (should be smaller, half-page height)
- **Website Content**: Pages load but formatting issues throughout
- **Routing**: Some pages (Jack, Luo blogs) not accessible due to routing issues

### ‚ùå Critical Issues to Fix

- **About Section**: Completely non-functional, facts not displaying
- **404 Page**: Not properly updated with site styling
- **Full-page Scroll**: Scroll bar in container instead of full page, feels unnatural
- **Journey Page**: Missing creative content and up-to-date projects
- **TurboPack Issue**: Development server fails with --turbo flag
- **Default Vercel/Next.js Images**: Need to be deleted
