# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating Jack Luo's personal portfolio website from a legacy HTML/CSS/JS implementation to a modern Next.js 16 application with Vercel deployment. The migration is structured in three phases: static site migration with performance focus, dynamic content with analytics, and AI integration.

The legacy website (https://jack-luo.com) serves as the foundation, but the goal is to create a polished, modernized version that feels like the original but significantly improved. The approach is systematic and methodical - assume all existing components are broken until proven working.

**Key Technology Requirements:**
- Next.js 16 (latest version)
- Vercel deployment for optimal performance
- Test-driven development approach
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modern tooling (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript strict mode)
