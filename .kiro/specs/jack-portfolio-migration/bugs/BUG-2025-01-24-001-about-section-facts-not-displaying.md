## Investigation Log

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. **Why are the facts not displaying?** The AboutSection component is not rendering the facts content
2. **Why is the component not rendering facts?** Likely missing data binding or conditional rendering issue
3. **Why is data binding missing?** Component may not be fetching data from the correct source
4. **Why is data source incorrect?** Need to verify if facts data exists in Sanity CMS or static files
5. **Why is data source unclear?** Initial implementation may have focused on layout without content integration

### Investigation Steps Needed
1. **Examine AboutSection.tsx** for data fetching logic
2. **Check Sanity CMS schema** for facts/about content structure
3. **Verify static data files** for fallback content
4. **Test component rendering** with mock data
5. **Implement proper error handling** and loading states
