# Bug Report: TurboPack Compilation Failure

## Bug Information
- **ID**: BUG-2025-01-24-002
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-24
- **Reporter**: User/Developer
- **Severity**: Low
- **Category**: Build
- **Status**: Open
- **Environment**: Development

## Bug Description
### Summary
Next.js development server fails when using the `--turbo` flag for TurboPack compilation, while standard compilation works fine.

### Expected Behavior
`npm run dev -- --turbo` should start the development server with faster TurboPack compilation.

### Actual Behavior
TurboPack compilation fails with errors, preventing the development server from starting.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run dev -- --turbo` or `next dev --turbo`
2. Observe compilation errors
3. Compare with `npm run dev` which works normally

### Additional Context
- **Workaround Available**: Use standard Next.js compilation without `--turbo` flag
- **Impact**: Slower development builds, but non-blocking
- **Priority**: Low (workaround available)

## Investigation Log

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. **Why does TurboPack fail?** Compatibility issues with project configuration
2. **Why are there compatibility issues?** Likely related to CSS modules, Framer Motion, or custom fonts
3. **Why do these dependencies cause issues?** TurboPack may have different handling of these features
4. **Why is handling different?** TurboPack is still experimental and may not support all features
5. **Why continue using experimental features?** TurboPack offers significant performance benefits when working

### Potential Causes
- CSS Modules configuration compatibility
- Framer Motion dependencies
- Custom font imports and loading
- Sanity integration complexity

### Investigation Notes
- Project structure appears standard for Next.js
- Configuration files seem properly set up
- Issue likely specific to TurboPack's experimental nature

## Resolution Plan

### Immediate Actions
- [x] Document workaround (use standard compilation)
- [ ] Monitor Next.js TurboPack updates
- [ ] Test with future Next.js versions
- [ ] Consider reporting to Next.js team if issue persists

### Long-term Strategy
- Monitor TurboPack development progress
- Re-test with each Next.js update
- Consider configuration adjustments if patterns emerge

### Success Criteria
- [ ] TurboPack compilation works without errors
- [ ] Development server starts successfully with `--turbo` flag
- [ ] Build performance improves with TurboPack enabled

### Current Status
**Workaround**: Use `npm run dev` without `--turbo` flag for development
**Priority**: Low - does not block development progress
