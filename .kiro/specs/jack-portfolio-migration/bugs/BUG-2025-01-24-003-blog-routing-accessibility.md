## Investigation Log

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. **Why are blog pages not accessible?** Routing configuration may be incorrect
2. **Why is routing incorrect?** Blog page structure may not match Next.js App Router expectations
3. **Why doesn't structure match?** Migration from legacy HTML structure may be incomplete
4. **Why is migration incomplete?** Focus may have been on layout without proper routing setup
5. **Why wasn't routing prioritized?** Initial development focused on visual components first

### Investigation Steps Needed
1. **Check App Router structure** in `/app/blogs/` directory
2. **Verify page.tsx files** exist for jack and luo routes
3. **Test dynamic routing** configuration
4. **Examine navigation links** for correct href attributes
5. **Test both client-side and server-side routing**
