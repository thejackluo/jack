## Integration with Development Workflow

### Bug Tracking in Git
- Branch naming: `bugfix/BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX-description`
- Commit messages: `fix(component): resolve issue with X (closes BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX)`
- PR templates include bug reference and testing steps

### Automated Bug Detection
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, SonarQube for code issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: CloudWatch alerts for degradation
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for runtime errors
- **AI Monitoring**: Custom accuracy and hallucination detection

This standardized approach ensures consistent bug tracking, thorough root cause analysis, and continuous improvement of the ERA system quality.

## Bug Organization

### Bug Folder Structure

Create individual bug files in `.kiro/specs/jack-portfolio-migration/bugs/` directory:

```
.kiro/specs/jack-portfolio-migration/bugs/
├── BUG-2025-01-23-001.md
├── BUG-2025-01-23-002.md
├── BUG-2025-01-24-001.md
└── ...
```

### GitHub MCP Integration

All bugs should be tracked both in local files and connected to GitHub issues via MCP server:

- **Local Tracking**: Maintain detailed bug files in the bugs folder
- **GitHub Integration**: Create corresponding GitHub issues for collaboration
- **Sync Process**: Use MCP server to sync status and updates between local files and GitHub
- **Reference Format**: Include GitHub issue number in bug files: `GitHub Issue: #123`

### Production vs Development Considerations

#### MVP Phase (Current)
- **Impact Assessment**: Not applicable (no production users)
- **Focus Areas**: Functional bugs, development workflow issues
- **Simplified Reporting**: Use basic template for quick issue capture
- **Investigation**: Full investigation template only when resolving

#### Production Phase (Future)
- **Impact Assessment**: Include user count, business impact, revenue implications
- **Monitoring Integration**: Automatic bug detection from production alerts
- **SLA Requirements**: Response time commitments based on severity
- **Customer Communication**: External communication templates

## Bug File Management

### Individual Bug Files

Each bug gets its own file in the bugs folder:

**File Naming**: `BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX.md`
**Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Bug Report: [Title]

[Initial bug report using simple template]

---

## Investigation Log

[Investigation details added during resolution]

---

## Resolution

[Final resolution and prevention measures]
```

### Commit Message Integration

When fixing bugs, include commit summary in the bug file:

```markdown
## Resolution Commits

### Commit: [commit-hash]
**Message**: `fix(component): resolve issue with X (closes BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX)`
**Summary**: [Brief description of what was changed and why]
**Files Changed**: [List of modified files]
